\label{sec: Model Specification}

As our data has a specific structure, some transformations can be made to increase performance and stability. The most prominent characteristic of our data is its amount of 0 or null values. As both CoDA and INGARCH can't handle an excessive amount of 0 values, we have to accommodate for this.
