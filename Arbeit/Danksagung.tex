At this point, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Univ.Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Peter Filzmoser for the help he provided in the form of resources, answers to my questions and in general the excellent guidance during my thesis. In this context I also have to thank Dipl.-Ing. Lukas Neubauer who worked on this project with me and supported me not only in the analysis and interpretation of the results but also with suggestions and insightful comments. I also want to thank Schrankerl GmbH for providing the data used for carrying out the analyis.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my family and especially my parents who gave me the opportunity to study and supported me the whole time. I also want to thank my friends and colleagues who accompanied me during this journey and made this an unforgettable time.
