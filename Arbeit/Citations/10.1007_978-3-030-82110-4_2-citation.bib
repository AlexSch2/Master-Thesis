abstract="To deal with time series process with excess of zeros, we extend the INAR(1) process by considering that the innovations follow different zero-inflated models, called the ZI-INAR(1) model. We present some of its theoretical properties, develop an efficient EM algorithm for parameter estimation and propose several bootstrap techniques to construct confidence intervals for the parameters. Finally, we present the relevance and applicability the of proposed ZI-INAR(1) model through simulation studies and an application to a real dataset.",
