abstract = {Daily precipitation has been successfully modeled by the Discrete Autoregressive Moving Average (DARMA) family of models. One of these models is used in the estimation of daily streamflows by means of a linear transfer function. The statistical properties of the chosen DARMA precipitation process and the first- and second-order statistics of the relationships between daily precipitation and the corresponding streamflow are used in the determination of the transfer function parameters. The constructed process is applied to a watershed located in Indiana. The model identification, the parameter estimation, and the diagnostic checking are illustrated. This transfer model has the merit that it couples the first- and second-order statistics of the rainfall input and runoff output. The model limitations stem from the stationarity of the DARMA models used for the description of daily rainfall sequences. This requires the division of the year into stationary seasons and introduces minor inaccuracies at the season crossings.}
