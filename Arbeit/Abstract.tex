In this thesis we analyse and compare two approaches for multivariate count data time series with an excessive amount of zeros. The first approach belongs to the class of generalised linear models (GLM) and fits an univariate integer valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model of order (p,q) (INGARCH(p,q) model) for each dimension. The second approach is based on compositional data analysis (CoDA) and uses the relative structure of our data to build a vectorised autoregressive (VAR) model from it. In addition, we also consider alternative options like zero-inflated models and vectorised general additive models. We provide the mathematical background for the INGARCH(p,q) and CoDA approach and explore different parameter settings of them. We evaluate their performance on real world data and compare different tuning options. We introduce an error measure for comparison and also use it to compare the performance on different time series. We conduct our analysis in the statistical software R and present the used packages and functions. \newline
