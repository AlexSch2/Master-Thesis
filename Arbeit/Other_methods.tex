\subsection{Naive Random Walk}
\label{sec: Naive Random Walk}

This method acts as kind of benchmark model and is what is currently used for forecasting. Let $\left\{Y_t:t\in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ be again our timeseries. Then

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_{t+1} = Y_t ,\hspace{0.2cm} \forall t \in \mathbb{N}
\label{eq: Random Walk Model}
\end{equation}

where $\hat{Y}_{t}$ is the predicted value at time $t$. In other words, the last known value is the predicted value.
