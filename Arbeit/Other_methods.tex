\subsection{Naive Random Walk}
\label{sec: Naive Random Walk}

This method acts as kind of benchmark model and is what is currently used for forecasting. Let $\left\{Y_{k_t}:t\in \mathbb{N}, Y_{k_t} \in \mathbb{N}_0\right\}_f$ be again the univariate time series for category $k$ for $k=1,\ldots,K$ and fridge $f$. Then

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_{k_{t+1}}= Y_{k_t} ,\hspace{0.2cm} \forall t \in \mathbb{N}, k=1,\ldots,K
\label{eq: Random Walk Model}
\end{equation}

where $\hat{Y}_{k_{t+1}}$ is the predicted value at time $t$. In other words, the last known value is the predicted value. 


\subsection{Zero-Inflated Models}
\label{sec: Zim}

Since we encounter a large number of zeros we also consider zero-inflated models. The idea of zero-inflated models is to add a degenerated distribution with mass at zero to the probability mass function. This way we can explain the large amount of zero values which would not be expected in a normal Poisson distribution. The zero-inflated INGARCH(p,q) model is equivalent to \ref{eq:Ingarch model} and only the conditional distribution of $Y_{k_t}=y | \SigA_{t-1}$ changes. Instead of \ref{eq:Ingarch Distribution} it is now 

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}(Y_{k_t}=y | \SigA_{t-1}) = \omega \delta_{y,0}+ (1-\omega) \frac{\lambda_t^y \exp(-\lambda_t)}{y!}, \hspace{0.2cm} y \in \mathbb{N}_0.
\label{eq:ZIP Distribution}
\end{equation}

where $0 < \omega < 1$ and $\delta_{y,0}$ is the Kronecker delta for which $\delta_{y,0}=1$ if $y=0$ and $\delta_{y,0}=0$ else. This way our zeros can come from two different sources. If $\omega =0$ then we get the normal INGARCH(p,q) model discussed above. More details about zero-inflated models and especially zero-inflated INGARCH(p,q) model can be found in \cite{Zhu:2012}.


\subsection{Log-Linear Models}
\label{sec: Log-Linear Models}

As mentioned in \ref{sec:Ingarch Motivation} we also investigate log-linear models. These models are structurally very similar to the normal INGARCH(p,q) model only with a logarithmic link function. It has the form 

\begin{equation}
\nu_t= \log(\lambda_t) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p\beta_i \log(Y_{k_{t-i}}+1) + \sum_{j=1}^q\alpha_j \nu_{t-j}.
\label{eq:Log-Linear model}
\end{equation}

The past values get transformed by $h(x)=\log(x+1)$ to get them on the same scale as $\nu_t$ and avoid zero values in the logarithm \cite{Liboschik:2016,Fokianos:2011}. In comparison to the INGARCH(p,q) model, the log-linear model also supports modeling of negative serial correlation \cite{Liboschik:2016}. It is further discussed in \cite{Fokianos:2011,Woodard:2011,Douc:2013}.


\subsection{Vector Generalised Additive Models}
\label{sec:Vgam}

Because we work with multivariate count data, we also look at vector generalised additive models (VGAMs) which extend generalised additive models to higher dimensions. Let 

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\bm{Y}_t] = \bm{\beta}_0 + \sum_{k=1}^K\bm{f}_k(Y_{k_{t-1}})
\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
