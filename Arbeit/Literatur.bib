abstract = {Multivariate time series describing relative contributions to a total (like proportional data) are called compositional time series. They need to be transformed first to the usual Euclidean geometry before a time series model is fitted. It is shown how an appropriate transformation can be chosen, resulting in coordinates with respect to the Aitchison geometry of compositional data. Using vector autoregressive models, the standard approach based on raw data is compared with the compositional approach based on transformed data. The results from the compositional approach are consistent with the relative nature of the observations, while the analysis of the raw data leads to several inconsistencies and artifacts. The compositional approach is extended to the case when also the total of the compositional parts is of interest. Moreover, a concise methodology for an interpretation of the coordinates in the transformed space together with the corresponding statistical inference (like hypotheses testing) is provided.

It is pertinent when the analyst assumes that the relevant information is contained on the relative variation structure of the data. For instance, in cases where the experimental data are simultaneously measured in amounts related to a same total weight or volume. The approach is used in fields like geochemistry of waters or sedimentary rocks, environmental studies related to air pollution, physicochemical analysis of glass fragments in forensic science, and among many others. In these fields, rounded zeros and nondetects are usually regarded as left-censored data that hamper any subsequent data analysis. The implemented methods consider aspects of relevance for a compositional approach such as scale invariance, subcompositional coherence or preserving the multivariate relative structure of the data. Based on solid statistical frameworks, it comprises the ability to deal with single and varying censoring thresholds, consistent treatment of closed and non-closed data, exploratory tools, multiple imputation, MCMC, robust and non-parametric alternatives, and recent proposals for count data. Key methodological aspects, new contributions, computational implementation and the practical application of the approach are discussed.}

  abstract={This paper introduces and evaluates new models for time series count data. The Autoregressive Conditional Poisson model (ACP) makes it possible to deal with issues of discreteness, overdispersion (variance greater than the mean) and serial correlation. A fully parametric approach is taken and a marginal distribution for the counts is specified, where conditional on past observations the mean is autoregressive. This enables to attain improved inference on coefficients of exogenous regressors relative to static Poisson regression, which is the main concern of the existing literature, while modelling the serial correlation in a flexible way. A variety of models, based on the double Poisson distribution of Efron (1986) is introduced, which in a first step introduce an additional dispersion parameter and in a second step make this dispersion parameter time-varying. All models are estimated using maximum likelihood which makes the usual tests available. In this framework autocorrelation can be tested with a straightforward likelihood ratio test, whose simplicity is in sharp contrast with test procedures in the latent variable time series count model of Zeger (1988). The models are applied to the time series of monthly polio cases in the U.S between 1970 and 1983 as well as to the daily number of price change durations of :75$ on the IBM stock. A .75$ price change duration is defined as the time it takes the stock price to move by at least .75$. The variable of interest is the daily number of such durations, which is a measure of intradaily volatility, since the more volatile the stock price is within a day, the larger the counts will be. The ACP models provide good density forecasts of this measure of volatility.},

abstract = {Daily precipitation has been successfully modeled by the Discrete Autoregressive Moving Average (DARMA) family of models. One of these models is used in the estimation of daily streamflows by means of a linear transfer function. The statistical properties of the chosen DARMA precipitation process and the first- and second-order statistics of the relationships between daily precipitation and the corresponding streamflow are used in the determination of the transfer function parameters. The constructed process is applied to a watershed located in Indiana. The model identification, the parameter estimation, and the diagnostic checking are illustrated. This transfer model has the merit that it couples the first- and second-order statistics of the rainfall input and runoff output. The model limitations stem from the stationarity of the DARMA models used for the description of daily rainfall sequences. This requires the division of the year into stationary seasons and introduces minor inaccuracies at the season crossings.}

 abstract = {Time series sometimes consist of count data in which the number of events occurring in a given time interval is recorded. Such data are necessarily nonnegative integers, and an assumption of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is often appropriate. This article sets ups a model in which the level of the process generating the observations changes over time. A recursion analogous to the Kalman filter is used to construct the likelihood function and to make predictions of future observations. Qualitative variables, based on a binomial or multinomial distribution, may be handled in a similar way. The model for count data may be extended to include explanatory variables. This enables nonstochastic slope and seasonal components to be included in the model, as well as permitting intervention analysis. The techniques are illustrated with a number of applications, and an attempt is made to develop a model-selection strategy along the lines of that used for Gaussian structural time series models. The applications include an analysis of the results of international football matches played between England and Scotland and an assessment of the effect of the British seat-belt law on the drivers of light-goods vehicles.},

Such a stochastic operator appears to be more flexible than the currently popular thinning operator to construct Box and Jenkins’ type stationary ARMA processes with arbitrary discrete marginal distributions. This flexibility allows us to yield an ARMA model for time series of binomial or categorical observations as a special case, which was unavailable with the extended thinning operator [Joe, H., 1996. Time series models with univariate margins in the convolution-closed infinitely divisible class. J. Appl.

The stationarity conditions and the autocorrelation function are given. Based on the EM algorithm, the estimating procedure is simple and easy to be implemented. A simulation study shows that the estimation method is accurate and reliable as long as the sample size is reasonably large.

In addition time dependent covariates are accommodated in a straightforward way. We study its probabilistic properties and maximum likelihood estimation. It is shown that a perturbed version of the process is geometrically ergodic, and, under some conditions, it approaches the non-perturbed version. In addition, it is proved that the maximum likelihood estimator of the vector of unknown parameters is asymptotically normal with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. The results are based on minimal assumptions and can be extended to the case of log-linear regression with continuous exogenous variables. The theory is applied to aggregated financial transaction time series. In particular, we discover positive association between the number of transactions and the volatility process of a certain stock.}

 abstract = {Representation of generalized additive models (GAM's) using penalized regression splines allows GAM's to be employed in a straightforward manner using penalized regression methods. Not only is inference facilitated by this approach, but it is also possible to integrate model selection in the form of smoothing parameter selection into model fitting in a computationally efficient manner using well founded criteria such as generalized cross-validation. The current fitting and smoothing parameter selection methods for such models are usually effective, but do not provide the level of numerical stability to which users of linear regression packages, for example, are accustomed. In particular the existing methods cannot deal adequately with numerical rank deficiency of the GAM fitting problem, and it is not straightforward to produce methods that can do so, given that the degree of rank deficiency can be smoothing parameter dependent. In addition, models with the potential flexibility of GAM's can also present practical fitting difficulties as a result of indeterminacy in the model likelihood: Data with many zeros fitted by a model with a log link are a good example. In this article it is proposed that GAM's with a ridge penalty provide a practical solution in such circumstances, and a multiple smoothing parameter selection method suitable for use in the presence of such a penalty is developed. The method is based on the pivoted QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition, so that with or without a ridge penalty it has good error propagation properties and is capable of detecting and coping elegantly with numerical rank deficiency. The method also allows mixtures of user specified and estimated smoothing parameters and the setting of lower bounds on smoothing parameters. In terms of computational efficiency, the method compares well with existing methods. A simulation study compares the method to existing methods, including treating GAM's as mixed models.},
